# Web-App-Directory-Hunter #

This Python tool is designed to facilitate the enumeration of directories and files on web and application servers. It allows users to input a target URL and a list of directories, after which the tool systematically attempts to access these directories using HTTP requests. While not a comprehensive iterative search, it provides a basic directory and file name enumeration method for initial web application assessment.

Key Features:

- Input a target URL for directory enumeration
- Utilize a list of directories for testing
- Efficiently discover accessible directories and potential file paths

Please note that this tool is intended for ethical and responsible use, such as website security assessments, and should not be used for any unauthorized or malicious activities.

## Usage ##

```python3 dirscanner.py```

- Target URL Input: Enter the target URL to be probed for directories
- Directory List Input: Provide a list containing directory names for execution
